This is a versatile modpack installer that can be used for any mod combination.

It is mainly designed with ease of use in mind for less technologically adept people.
It contains a simple, easy to understand menu that explains what the program is doing during the installation process.

Off the bat, the default file will NOT install mods. 
Use the %Modx% placeholders to fill in for up to 5 mods. Past 5 you'll have to do some other tweaks. 
Simply CTRL+F for %Modx% placeholders and you can add extra entries to the necessary lines.

This repo is mainly for the code hosting, for actual use from this source you'll need to edit the file yourself.
